# code-quiz
AS A coding boot camp student I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## GIVEN I am taking a code quiz:

1. WHEN I click the start button;
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

2. WHEN I answer a question;
- THEN I am presented with another question

3. WHEN I answer a question incorrectly;
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock

4. WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0;
- THEN the game is over

5. WHEN the game is over;
- THEN I can save my initials and score!
